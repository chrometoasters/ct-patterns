## By default, when JavaScript is not available

* All blocks are expanded.
* Each block expander is anchor linked to the block which it expands.
* Clicking the block expander jumps the page down to the top of the linked block.

## When JavaScript is available

* All blocks are collapsed.
* Each block expander is anchor linked to the block which it expands.
* Clicking the block expander expands the associated block, the page does not jump.
